- **Managers**: Singleton classes for sound, haptics, and favorites
- **Data**: Local storage using UserDefaults

### Key Components

- `WorkoutModel`: Core timer and workout state management with screen wake prevention
- `SoundManager`: Audio playback with music-friendly settings and enhanced workout cues
- `HapticManager`: Tactile feedback for better user experience
