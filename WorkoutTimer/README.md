## Architecture

The app follows MVVM architecture with SwiftUI:

- **Models**: `WorkoutModel` manages workout state and timer logic
- **Views**: SwiftUI views for UI components
- **Managers**: Singleton classes for sound, haptics, and favorites
- **Data**: Local storage using UserDefaults

### Key Components

- `WorkoutModel`: Core timer and workout state management
- `SoundManager`: Audio playback with music-friendly settings
- `HapticManager`: Tactile feedback for better user experience
